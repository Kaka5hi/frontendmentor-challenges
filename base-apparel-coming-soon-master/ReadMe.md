## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

I always start with deciding how many sections I need to build the layout, then divide those sections in divs(block level elements in HTML) which makes the work easy. I prefer writing whole HTML first and then jumping on CSS because it provide structure visually and makes styling easy. For CSS part basic stuff first like - importing fonts/icons asap, set some default styling. I'm quite comfortable with Flexbox, so use that most of the times, but I can also achieve the same layout with Grid as well. My approach is simple if their are 2-3 sections side by side I can easily adjust them using flexbox and if they exceeds in number I prefer using Grid.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup - Section, Article, Aside
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Position
- Desktop-first workflow
- Responsive view for small screen sizes
- Javascript for email validation (using Regex)

### What I learned

- Layout design and positioning elements.
- Toggling between different image sections for Web-view(big screens) and Mobile-view(small screens).
- Started building this while learning Javascript, which was good test for me on some of the concepts of JS as well as get to learn the about Regex.

## Special Mention

This section is dedicated to FrontEnd Mentor. Thank you for providing these challenges which not only test our knowledge and skills but also provide an experience. As a beginner it was always hard to find the designs or resources for practise, and because of these challenges I was able to escape the tutorial hell. Even though this was the beginner project, it had its own challenge which helped me going one step forward.

These challenges not only improve my development skills of the domain but also improve an eye for designing skills as well.
